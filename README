Reinforcement learning Project
Built a generalized Atari game player algorithm using only game play pixel information and game score.
Implemented the policy network as a multinoulli distribution with discounted rewards as the score function.
Implemented a stochastic model using Policy Gradients with a Feed Forward Neural Network as function approximator and performed model optimization with batch updates using RMSProp.
Used OpenAI Gym for game environment simulation and TensorFlow for the numerical computations.
